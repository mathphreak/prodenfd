# `prodenfd`
The Productivity Enforcement Daemon enforces productivity by killing timewasters while productivity is insufficient.

## Productivity

Measuring productivity is difficult, but the easy way to measure productivity is to check with an external todo list.
Since I use Wunderlist, that's what `prodenfd` supports.

## Enforcement

Detecting wasted time is difficult, but the easy way is to kill a process if it's running.
Since I play a lot of Steam games, that's what `prodenfd` supports.
